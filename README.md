# TypescriptDecorators

Several convenient decorators to use in Angular projects

### Where's the code?!
The decorators are wrapped within an Angular CLI project for ease of development.
The decorators and their respective test files are in `projects/decorators/lib` with dedicated README.md with more in depth descriptions and examples.
Checkout [Angular's Github on "stories create library"](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library)_, for more info on how to work with angular libraries

*Tips or additions are always welcome*
*I have not yet placed the library on NPM, since it currently only has one decorator. This might change in the future.*
