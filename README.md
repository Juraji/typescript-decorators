# TypescriptDecorators

Several convenient decorators for use in Angular projects

### Where's the code?!
The decorators are wrapped within an Angular CLI project for ease of development.
The decorators and their respective test files are in [projects/decorators/lib](https://github.com/Juraji/typescript-decorators/tree/master/projects/decorators/src/lib) with dedicated README.md with more in depth descriptions and examples.
Checkout [Angular's Github on "stories create library"](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-create-library) for more info on how to work with angular libraries
